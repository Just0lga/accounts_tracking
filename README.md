## 📱 Subscription Tracker (No Backend Needed)

A lightweight mobile application designed to help users track their monthly app and service subscriptions without relying on any external backend or cloud services.

### 💡 Why I Built This

In today's digital world, many people pay for multiple subscription-based apps and services every month (Netflix, Spotify, cloud storage, etc.). It can be difficult to keep track of what you're paying for, when payments are due, and how much you're spending overall. Most solutions on the market require account sign-ins or cloud syncing. This app offers a fully **offline-first** experience by storing data locally on the user's device.

### 🔧 Features

- Add and manage unlimited subscriptions  
- Set monthly or yearly renewal dates  
- View total monthly cost summary  
- Edit or delete subscriptions easily  
- Fully offline — uses local storage, no backend or internet required  
- Built with a focus on privacy and simplicity  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile development  
- **Local storage** with `shared_preferences` or `sqflite`  
- Clean and minimal UI design  

### 🔒 Privacy First

All data is stored locally on your device. No data is shared or uploaded anywhere.
